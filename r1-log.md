### Day 11: March 23

**Today's Progress**:
- Working on Project Endorsements, complete tasks: use localStorage to prevent users like the same post more than once; make css dryer; improve UX and accessibility

**Thoughts:**
- Thought about using form tags to required users to input but don't want to deal with form action, so add alert in js instead

### Day 12: March 25

**Today's Progress**:
- Working on the last module 3 project choreslist, almost completed. Todo: make the list unduplicated; click on individual chores to remove from list; show a random gif when all chores are completed

**Thoughts:**
- Too tired to work and this simple project is a good one to start the week.

### Day 13: March 26

**Today's Progress**:
- Complete project Choreslist todos.
- Improve project Endorsements based on review suggestion, make js code more commented and organized.
- TMR todos: learn and apply modal boxes as notification for project Choreslist and Endorsements.

### Day 14: March 27

**Today's Progress**:
- Project Choreslist: implement modal box
- Project Endorsements: Instead of throwing alert, make use of required attribute of form tags, also cancle form's default action in js.
- Refactor js with innerHTML and cleanHTML.js (sanitize third-party content) Manually creating markup is safe, but sometimes it's a LOT of code.
